# Null in Vint

The `null` data type in Vint represents the absence of a value or the concept of "nothing" or "empty." This page covers the syntax and usage of the `null` data type in Vint, including its definition and evaluation.

## Definition

A `null` data type is a data type with no value, defined with the `null` keyword:

```vint
let a = null
```

## Evaluation

When evaluating a `null` data type in a conditional expression, it will evaluate to `false`:

```vint
if (a) {
    print("a is null")
} else {
    print("a has a value")
}

// Output: a has a value
```

The `null` data type is useful in Vint when you need to represent an uninitialized, missing, or undefined value in your programs. By understanding the `null` data type, you can create more robust and flexible code.
