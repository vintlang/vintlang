# Identifiers in Vint

Identifiers are used to name variables, functions, and other elements in your **Vint** code. This guide explains the rules and best practices for creating effective identifiers.

## Syntax Rules

Identifiers can include letters, numbers, and underscores. However, they must adhere to these rules:

- **Cannot start with a number.**
- **Case-sensitive:** For example, `myVar` and `myvar` are considered different identifiers.

### Examples of Valid Identifiers:

```vint
let birth_year = 2020
print(birth_year)  // Output: 2020

let convert_c_to_p = "C to P"
print(convert_c_to_p)  // Output: "C to P"
```

In the examples above, `birth_year` and `convert_c_to_p` follow all syntax rules and are valid identifiers.

## Best Practices

To make your **Vint** code more readable and maintainable, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Descriptive Names:** Choose names that clearly describe the purpose or content of the variable or function.
   ```vint
   let total_score = 85
   let calculate_average = func() { /* logic */ }
   ```

2. **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Stick to a single naming style across your codebase:
   - **camelCase**: `myVariableName`
   - **snake_case**: `my_variable_name`

3. **Avoid Ambiguity:** Use meaningful names instead of single letters, except for common cases like loop counters:
   ```vint
   for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       print(i)
   }
   ```

4. **Do Not Use Reserved Keywords:** Avoid using reserved keywords as identifiers (e.g., `let`, `if`, `switch`).
