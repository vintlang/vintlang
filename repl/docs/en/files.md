# Files in vint

vint's ability to deal with files is primitive, and as for now it only allows you to read contents of a file.

## Opening a File

You open a file with the `fungua` keyword. This will return an object of type `FAILI`:
```
fileYangu = fungua("file.txt")

aina(fileYangu) // FAILI
```

## Reading a File

Once you have a file object you can read its contents with the `soma()` method. This will return the contents of the file as a string:
```
fileYangu = fungua("file.txt")

fileYangu.soma()
```
