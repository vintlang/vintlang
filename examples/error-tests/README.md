# Filename-in-Error-Messages Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Lexer Enhancements

- Added `filename` field to `Lexer` struct  
- Created `NewWithFilename()` constructor function
- Updated error message format from `Line X:Y:` to `filename:X:Y:`
- Added `GetFilename()` method for accessing filename

### ✅ Parser Enhancements  

- Updated all error messages to include filename using `p.l.GetFilename()`
- Format changed from `Line X:` to `filename:X:`
- Parser errors now clearly indicate which file contains the problem

### ✅ Main Program Integration

- Updated `main.go` to use `lexer.NewWithFilename()` with actual file path
- Modified REPL to support filename-aware error reporting
- Added `ReadWithFilename()` function to REPL for file execution
- Fixed panic issue when parsing fails by preventing evaluation of failed parses

### ✅ Test Organization  

- Moved all error test files to `/examples/error-tests/` directory
- Created comprehensive test cases demonstrating the feature
- Organized 10+ test files for various error scenarios

## Error Message Format Improvements

### Before:

```
Line 15: Expected next token to be =, got INT instead
```

### After:

```
examples/error-tests/final-demo.vint:15: Expected next token to be =, got INT instead
```

## Benefits for Developers

1. **Multi-File Project Support**: Clearly identify which file contains errors
2. **IDE Integration**: Better integration with error reporting tools  
3. **Debugging Efficiency**: Faster error location and resolution
4. **Professional Output**: Industry-standard error format (filename:line:column)

## Test Coverage

The implementation was tested with:
- ✅ Lexer errors (illegal characters)
- ✅ Parser errors (syntax issues)
- ✅ Multi-file scenarios
- ✅ REPL vs file execution
- ✅ Complex error combinations

## Future Enhancements Available

- Runtime/evaluator errors with filename context (requires deeper integration)
- Stack traces showing call chains across files  
- Column-level error reporting for evaluator errors

## Files Modified

- `lexer/lexer.go`: Added filename support and error formatting
- `parser/parser.go`: Updated error messages to include filenames
- `main.go`: Integration with filename-aware lexer
- `repl/repl.go`: Added filename support for file execution
- `examples/error-tests/`: Comprehensive test suite
